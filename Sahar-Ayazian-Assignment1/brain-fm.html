            <p>
                Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit
                strong neural phase locking-allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated
                activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.
            </p>
            <p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words,
                we've found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do. </p>

                Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.
            </p>
            <p>
                We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale
                behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo')</b> of
                the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes
                the difference.
